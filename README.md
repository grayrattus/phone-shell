TODO:
- add command that will use raport script to generate raport from last 1 week of diary
- add command that will sort entries in diary

DONE: 

09/08/21#21:12:02 😐 - add chart for days
	In the end I simplified this a bit but it sill works fine.
```
	I would really like to have something like this:

	.     :.
	::    ::
	:: .. :: .. :: ..
	Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su

	And this should be done with different colors. I started to work on raport.sh function that should achive that.
```
